## 📊 Overview  

TUKAcad is a complete digital pattern engineering platform tailored for the apparel and fashion industry. It replaces traditional manual drafting with an efficient computer-aided workflow, giving designers and pattern makers full control over precision garment development. With a comprehensive toolset for drafting, grading, and marker creation, the software supports everything from early prototyping to large-scale production planning.

Its pattern-making environment allows users to construct and refine garment components with a high level of accuracy. Tools for shaping curves, adding seam allowances, adjusting darts, and controlling measurements help create complex silhouettes with consistency. Whether producing casualwear, technical garments, or haute couture patterns, TUKAcad adapts easily to varied design requirements.

A standout element of TUKAcad is its powerful grading engine. It enables users to automatically generate multiple sizes based on custom or standardized measurement tables. The grading preview system ensures that patterns scale correctly and maintain their intended fit across entire size ranges, reducing developmental time and improving reliability.

Fabric efficiency is enhanced through the built-in marker-making module, which arranges pattern pieces using optimized layouts to minimize material waste. Users can adjust grainlines, spacing rules, and fabric orientations to create production-ready markers suited for factory workflows. This capability is essential for teams looking to control costs and streamline manufacturing.

TUKAcad is widely adopted across educational institutions, factories, and design studios thanks to its precision, flexibility, and ability to modernize garment creation. By digitizing the full pattern workflow—from initial draft to pre-production—it provides fashion professionals with a consistent, scalable, and highly accurate engineering environment.
